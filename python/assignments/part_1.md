# Python Basics: Easy Assignments for Beginners

## Assignment 1: Variables and Data Types

Create a program that does the following:
1. Create a variable `name` and assign it your name as a string.
2. Create a variable `age` and assign it your age as an integer.
3. Create a variable `height` and assign it your height in meters as a float.
4. Create a variable `is_student` and assign it a boolean value indicating whether you're a student or not.
5. Print out all these variables in a sentence format.

Example output:
```
My name is John, I am 25 years old, my height is 1.75 meters, and it is True that I am a student.
```

## Assignment 2: Lists

Create a program that does the following:
1. Create a list called `favorite_foods` with at least 3 of your favorite foods.
2. Print the list.
3. Add a new food item to the end of the list using the `append()` method.
4. Print the updated list.
5. Print the second item in the list.
6. Change the last item in the list to a different food.
7. Print the final version of the list.

## Assignment 3: If-Else Statements

Create a program that determines the phase of water based on its temperature:
1. Ask the user to input a temperature in Celsius (use `input()` function and convert it to a float).
2. Use if-elif-else statements to determine if the water is in solid, liquid, or gas form:
   - If the temperature is less than 0째C, it's solid (ice).
   - If the temperature is between 0째C and 100째C (inclusive), it's liquid.
   - If the temperature is above 100째C, it's gas (steam).
3. Print out the result.

## Assignment 4: Operators

Create a simple calculator program:
1. Ask the user to input two numbers (use `input()` function and convert them to floats).
2. Perform the following operations and print the results:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
   - Floor Division
   - Modulus (remainder)
   - Exponentiation (first number raised to the power of the second number)
3. For each operation, print a sentence explaining the operation and its result.

## Assignment 5: Combining Concepts

Create a program that manages a simple to-do list:
1. Create an empty list called `todo_list`.
2. Use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user if they want to add an item to the list or quit.
3. If they choose to add an item, ask for the item and append it to the list.
4. If they choose to quit, exit the loop.
5. After the loop ends, print out the final to-do list.
6. If the list has more than 3 items, print "You have a busy day ahead!". Otherwise, print "Your day looks manageable."
