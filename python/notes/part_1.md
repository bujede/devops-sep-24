# Python Basics: Notes for Beginners

## 1. Variables

- Variables are containers for storing data values.
- In Python, you don't need to declare variable types explicitly.
- Variable names should be descriptive and follow naming conventions (lowercase with underscores).

Example:
```python
age = 25
name = "John"
height = 1.75
```

## 2. Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

1. Integers (int): Whole numbers
2. Floating-point numbers (float): Decimal numbers
3. Strings (str): Text enclosed in quotes
4. Booleans (bool): True or False values

Example:
```python
x = 10  # integer
y = 3.14  # float
message = "Hello, World!"  # string
is_student = True  # boolean
```

## 3. Lists

- Lists are ordered, changeable collections of items.
- They can contain elements of different data types.
- List items are enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.

Example:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mixed_list = [1, "two", 3.0, True]
```

## 4. If-Else Statements

- If-else statements allow you to make decisions in your code.
- The syntax uses indentation to define code blocks.

Example:
```python
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # code to execute if another_condition is True
else:
    # code to execute if all conditions are False
```

## 5. Operators

Python supports various types of operators:

1. Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
2. Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
3. Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
4. Assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.

Example:
```python
a = 10
b = 3

sum = a + b  # Addition
difference = a - b  # Subtraction
product = a * b  # Multiplication
quotient = a / b  # Division
```
